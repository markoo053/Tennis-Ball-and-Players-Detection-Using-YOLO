# Tennis-Ball-and-Players-Detection-Using-YOLO
• A real-time object detection solution using the YOLO model to accurately track tennis ball and players

• YOLOv5, YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 models were trained to detect tennis ball

• ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained to detect court key points

• Pre-trained YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 models used for players detection

• Evaluated detections using metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP and MSE
