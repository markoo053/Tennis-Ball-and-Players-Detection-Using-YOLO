# Tennis-Ball-and-Players-Detection-Using-YOLO
• A real-time object detection solution using the YOLO model to accurately track tennis ball and players
• YOLOv5, YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 models were trained to detect tennis ball (large and small variants of model)
• ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained to detect court key points (that will help in detecting players)
• Pre-trained YOLOv9 and YOLOv11 models used for players detection
• Evaluated detections using metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP and MSE
